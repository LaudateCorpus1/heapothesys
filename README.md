# Heapothesys 

## Introduction

Heapothesys (/hɪˈpɒθɪsɪs/) is a collection of JVM garbage collection workloads developed by the Amazon Corretto team.  These workloads are
intended to be useful in helping to compare alternative garbage collection algorithms and configuration choices, helping to evaluate proposed improvements to garbage collection algorithms and implementations, and helping to detect garbage collection performance and latency regressions.
